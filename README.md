<h1>NetForensix: Smart Network Intrusion Detection Tool</h1>

<b>NetForensix</b> is a powerful and intelligent network intrusion detection tool designed to bolster your network's security by identifying various network attacks. By analyzing network flow behavior, this tool can detect and provide insights into attacks such as Brute Force FTP, Brute Force SSH, DoS, Web Attacks, Botnets, DDoS, and more. Leveraging the CICIDS2017 dataset from Kaggle, NetForensix offers a robust solution for network forensics and intrusion detection.

<ul><li><h3>How to setup:</h3></li></ul>

1. Create a fork of this repo and clone into your local environment
2. Create a new branch
3. Install all dependencies by following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Open deploy_model.ipynb file in ML_model folder and run each cell one by one. This will do a minor preprocessing,
    train, test your model and save it into a file using joblib that it will use later.
5. All done !!

<ul><li><h3>How to use:</h3></li></ul>

```bash
python3 src/main.py <options> <file>
```
1. After above given setup you can interact with the tool
2. Use follwing command to see all the options and how to use:
```bash
python3 src/main.py --help
```
3. To generate flow file use the follwing command:
```bash
python3 src/main.py -f --pcap <file_path>
```
4. To generate result of detected intrusions use the following command:
```bash
python3 src/main.py -r --pcap <file_path>
```

You will see the result on your cli and a file will be generated based on the chosen option.
